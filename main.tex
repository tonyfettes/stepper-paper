Challenge: pedanticism -- lots of boring steps that, once the student understands the idea, just litter the proof and obscure the key idea. Our approach is to develop a scoped filter system that allows us to write patterns that will be skipped or paused. Example:

(more sophisticated example where you show side-by-side the unfiltered and filtered version of the same stepping sequence)
fib, foldright, map

want to be able to step programs with holes, including error holes:
abstract foldright vs foldleft

Prior work summary: what have people tried to do to handle this challenge in the past? why is that not quite enough

our contributions:
- developed the hazel stepper and filter system, implemented it, deployed it in lecture (qualitative evaluation), deployed it to students (qualitative + quantitative evaluation), formalized the filter semantics, metatheory
