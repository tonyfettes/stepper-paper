To evaluate how our filtered calculus helps teachers and students learn
functional programming, we integrated it into a university course on
functional programming languages.

\subsection{Lecture Integration}

\TODO{add content}

\subsection{Assignment Integration}

We evaluated our stepper on several assignments. They usually consist of
several tasks; each task asks students to implement or complete a function to
pass given unit tests. To help students better focus on their task, we
provided some prelude Hazel definitions that students can directly use in their
assignments. We do not want the students to be able to inspect the evaluation of
the prelude program, as this would break the imaginary narrative that all this
prelude content already exists in the environment. Therefore, we insert a
\lstinline[language=hazel]{debug hide($e)} at the very top of the program and a
\lstinline[language=hazel]{debug stop($e)} before the user program. Whenever the
user turns the stepper on, it will skip the execution of the prelude section and
stop at the entrance of the user program.

\subsubsection{Quantitative Feedback}

We collected anonymous data from students during one of their
assignments. The number of steps used by students is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:eval-num-steps}.

The first observation we made is that these students were never explicitly
told anything about how to use the stepper, and they weren't told to
use the stepper at any point in the homework, but almost half of them
saw the teacher use it in lecture and decided they wanted to use it.

However, as we can see, the number of steps used by students roughly
conforms to an exponential distribution. This implies that a small portion
of students use the stepper extensively, while most students
just briefly tried it or did not use it at all.
