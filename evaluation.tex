To evaluate how our filtered calculus helps with teachers and students during the learning of functional programming language,
we have integrated it into a course that works with functional programming languages at a university.

\subsection{Lecture Integration}

\TODO{add content}

\subsection{Assignment Integration}

The assignments we evaluated our stepper on usually consist of several
tasks, each tasks ask students to implement or complete a function to
pass given unit tests. To help students better focus on their task, we
have provided some prelude Hazel definitions that students can
directly use in their assignments. We do not want the students to be
able to inspect the evaluation of the prelude program, as this would
break the imaginary narrative that all these prelude content already
exists in the environment. Therefore, we insert a
\lstinline[language=hazel]{debug hide($e)} at the very top of the
program, and a \lstinline[language=hazel]{debug stop($e)} before the
user program. Whenever the user turn the stepper on, it will skip the
execution of the prelude section and stop at the entrance of the user
program.

\subsubsection{Quantitative Feedback}

We have collected anonymous data from students during one of their
assignments. The number of steps used by students is shown in the
Figure~\ref{fig:eval-num-steps}.

The first observation we made is, these students were never explicitly
told anything about how to use the stepper, and they weren't told to
use the stepper at any point in the homework, but almost half of them
saw the teacher use it in lecture and decided they wanted to use it.

However, as we can see, the number of steps used by students roughly
conforms to a exponential distribution. This implies a small portion
of students use the stepper extensively, while most of the students
just briefly tried it or not using it at all.
