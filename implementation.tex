\subsection{Mini Stepper}

A substitution based small-stepper evaluator of simply-typed lambda calculus with
fix point. The evaluator is implemented in OCaml, and is used to test the the
correctness of the behaviour as specify as the semantic rules in the paper.

\subsection{Hazel Implementation}

talk about how the big step + small step evaluator abstractions

environment-based evaluator + post-processing when showing in substitution mode

Optimisation for of the stepper filter: how we remove redundant filters (while
insure the correctness of the implementation?)

Equivalency of function:
\TODO{compare closure & structural equivalence of the body expression}
Finally we will move to UUID.
